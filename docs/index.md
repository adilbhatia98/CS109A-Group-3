# Overview

For our final project, we wanted to build a model that uses President Trump's tweets to predict changes in the VIX Index. Theoretically, a model performing accurately 51 (or higher) percent of the time provides a way to intelligently bet on market volatility and generate a positive return on average. 

We utilized Trump's Twitter archive [here](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive) to build our database of tweets, and we pulled minute-by-minute VIX data from an HBS Baker Library Bloomberg Terminal. Our analysis begins in May 2016 when Trump emerged as a solid, leading candidate for the GOP in the 2016 Presidential election.
